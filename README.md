# Gene Family Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline provides a comprehensive approach for Pan-genome based gene family analysis by integrating BLASTP and HMM methods for screening candidate gene sequences. An optional feature allows users to construct a phylogenetic tree automatically. This README details the pipeline workflow, requirements, and usage instructions.

## Overview

The gene family analysis pipeline is designed to identify and analyze candidate gene sequences by combining two independent screening methods:
1. **BLASTP Screening**: Compares input gene family FASTA sequences against a pre-built BLASTP database.
2. **HMM Screening**: Uses one or more HMM models to identify high-confidence candidate sequences in a protein database.

After the initial screening, candidate sequences are extracted and aligned using MAFFT. A new HMM model is then rebuilt to further refine candidate selection. Finally, the pipeline intersects the results from both methods, organizes the output files, and optionally constructs a phylogenetic tree. Pan-genome member statistics are generated based on a user-supplied sample ID file.

## Features

- **BLASTP Screening**: Filters candidate genes using an optional identity threshold.
- **HMM Screening**: Utilizes HMM models to screen for high-confidence candidate sequences (e-value < 1E-5).
- **Sequence Extraction & Alignment**: Extracts candidate sequences and performs multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT.
- **HMM Rebuilding**: Reconstructs a refined HMM model based on the aligned sequences.
- **Result Intersection**: Derives the final candidate gene set by intersecting BLASTP and HMM results.
- **File Organization**: Organizes intermediate and final output files into a user-specified directory.
- **Optional Phylogenetic Tree Construction**: Offers one-click tree construction using MAFFT and FastTree.
- **Pan-genome Statistics**: Computes candidate gene counts per sample based on a sample ID file (e.g., `110SampleID.txt`).

## Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed and accessible in your system's PATH:
- **BLASTP** (from the NCBI BLAST+ suite)
- **HMMER** (includes `hmmscan`, `hmmsearch`, `hmmbuild`)
- **MAFFT** (multiple sequence alignment tool)
- **Seqkit** (FASTA/Q file processing tool)
- **FastTree** (phylogenetic tree construction tool)

Additionally, prepare the following files:
- **Protein Database File**: e.g., `Pan110_xiaomi.fa`
- **BLASTP Database**: Pre-built BLASTP database files.
- **Gene Family FASTA File**: Input file for the gene family sequences (e.g., `AtSRS_10.fa`).
- **HMM Files**: One or more `.hmm` model files located in the script's directory.
- **Sample ID File**: e.g., `110SampleID.txt` for pan-genome member statistics.

---

## Usage

Run the script from the command line using:

```bash
bash genefamily_analysis.sh <gene_family_folder_name> <gene_family_fasta_file> [BLASTP_identity_threshold]
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Environment Dependencies**: Ensure all required tools (BLASTP, HMMER, MAFFT, Seqkit, FastTree) are installed and accessible in your systemâ€™s PATH.
- **Path Settings**: Verify that the paths for `PROTEIN_DB` and `BLASTP_DB` are correctly set and match your local environment.
- **HMM Files**: Ensure that all HMM model files are located in the same directory as the script.
- **Sample ID File**: Confirm that the sample ID file (e.g., `110SampleID.txt`) exists and is properly formatted.
